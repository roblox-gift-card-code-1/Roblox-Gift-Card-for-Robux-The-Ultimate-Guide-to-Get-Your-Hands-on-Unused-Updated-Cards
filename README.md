## What is a Roblox Gift Card?

A Roblox gift card is a prepaid card that can be redeemed for Robux or a Roblox Premium subscription. The cards come in various denominations and can be used to buy in-game items, avatar customization options, and other paid features within the Roblox platform.

### Types of Roblox Gift Cards

Roblox gift cards generally fall into two categories:

#### 1. **Robux Gift Cards**
These cards are the most common and are designed to provide users with Robux, the virtual currency used in Roblox. The Robux can be spent in the Roblox catalog to buy various items, from costumes and accessories for avatars to game passes and special abilities within games.

#### 2. **Roblox Premium Gift Cards**
In addition to Robux, some gift cards offer Roblox Premium subscriptions. A Roblox Premium membership grants players several benefits, including a monthly Robux allowance, exclusive access to premium items, and other perks that enhance the overall Roblox experience.

#### 3. **Gift Cards for Specific Games**
Occasionally, game developers within Roblox may offer specific gift cards for in-game purchases or special offers. These cards are often tied to specific games or events and allow players to unlock exclusive content or features within those titles.
